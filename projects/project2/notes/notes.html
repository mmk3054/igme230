  <h1>Hi</h1>
  <p>Source information for any images or code that you didn't create yourself (including CSS frameworks, typefaces, and any code libraries)
    Description of any particularly challenging aspects of the design and how you dealt with them.
    If you used a template or framework, explain how you modified it so that your portfolio has a unique look and feel.
    Anything that goes beyond the base expectations for the project--what did you do that was particularly challenging? This could involve art/design, content, or code.</p>
