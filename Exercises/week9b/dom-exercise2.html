        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>If what you're doing doesn't make you <strong>happy</strong> - you're doing the wrong thing. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. I want everybody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>
